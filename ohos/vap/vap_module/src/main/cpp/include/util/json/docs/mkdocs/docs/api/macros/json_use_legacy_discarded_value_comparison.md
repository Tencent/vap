# JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON

```cpp
#define JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON /* value */
```

This macro enables the (incorrect) legacy comparison behavior of discarded JSON values. Possible values are `1` to
enable or `0` to disable (default).

When enabled, comparisons involving at least one discarded JSON value yield results as follows:

| **Operator** | **Result**    |
|--------------|---------------|
| `==`         | `#!cpp false` |
| `!=`         | `#!cpp true`  |
| `<`          | `#!cpp false` |
| `<=`         | `#!cpp true`  |
| `>=`         | `#!cpp true`  |
| `>`          | `#!cpp false` |

Otherwise, comparisons involving at least one discarded JSON value always yield `#!cpp false`.

## Default definition

The default value is `0`.

```cpp
#define JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON 0
```

When the macro is not defined, the library will define it to its default value.

## Notes

!!! warning "Inconsistent behavior in C++20 and beyond"

    When targeting C++20 or above, enabling the legacy comparison behavior is _strongly_
    discouraged.

      - The 3-way comparison operator (`<=>`) will always give the correct result
        (`#!cpp std::partial_ordering::unordered`) regardless of the value of
        `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON`.
      - Overloads for the equality and relational operators emulate the legacy behavior.

    Code outside your control may use either 3-way comparison or the equality and relational operators, resulting in
    inconsistent and unpredictable behavior.

    See [`operator<=>`](../basic_json/operator_spaceship.md) for more information on 3-way comparison.

!!! warning "Deprecation"

    The legacy comparison behavior is deprecated and may be removed in a future major version release.

    New code should not depend on it and existing code should try to remove or rewrite expressions relying on it.

!!! hint "CMake option"

    Legacy comparison can also be controlled with the CMake option
    [`JSON_LegacyDiscardedValueComparison`](../../integration/cmake.md#json_implicitconversions)
    (`OFF` by default) which defines `JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON` accordingly.

## Examples

??? example

    The code below switches on the legacy discarded value comparison behavior in the library.

    ```cpp
    #define JSON_USE_LEGACY_DISCARDED_VALUE_COMPARISON 1
    #include <nlohmann/json.hpp>

    ...
    ```

## Version history

- Added in version 3.11.0.
